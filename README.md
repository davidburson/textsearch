# textsearch
create an app or script that runs on Windows.  It takes a list of texts as input and a folder.  It recursively searches the folder for all occurrences of those texts.  If any folder has a .gitignore file, for that folder skip its files and subfolders specified by the .gitignore, except always search files named ".env".  Do not search binary files.
